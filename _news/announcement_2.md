Tomorrow (October 12) in 2-132, I will give a talk titled **Fantastic Spanning Trees in Planar Graphs and Where to Find Them**, based on my joint work with my RSI student Alan, at the [**Simple Person's Applied Math Seminar (SPAMS)**](https://math.mit.edu/spams/). Food from 醉杭州 (including 酒酿圆子) will be provided! 🥘

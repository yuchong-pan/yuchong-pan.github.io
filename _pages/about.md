I am a graduate student in the MIT Mathematics Department. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Michel Goemans](https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/). Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics (Combined Honours) with Distinction at the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by [Bruce Shepherd](https://bshepherd.ca/). Even before that, I attended Shaoxing No. 1 High School, where I participated in competitive programming.

My research interests include algorithms, combinatorics and optimization, in particular designing discrete algorithms and analyzing discrete structures. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science, operations research and graph theory.

While not doing mathematics, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, kayaking and skiing. Check out photos on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/panyuchong/)!

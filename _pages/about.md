Hello! I am a third-year graduate student in the <a target="_blank" href='https://math.mit.edu/'>MIT Mathematics Department</a>, where I am very fortunate to be advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/">Professor Michel X. Goemans</a>. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics (Combined Honours) with Distinction at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>, where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://bshepherd.ca/">Professor F. Bruce Shepherd</a>. UBC has a stunning campus surrounded by forest on three sides and the Pacific Ocean on the fourth.

My research interests lie at the intersection of algorithms, combinatorics and optimization, in particular designing discrete algorithms and analyzing discrete structures. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science, operations research and graph theory.

When not doing mathematics, I enjoy hiking, backpacking and kayaking. I am completing the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-thousand_footers">"NH 48" list of 4000 footers in New Hampshire</a>.

You can find me at [first-name] [at] mit [dot] edu.

Hello! I am a third-year graduate student in the <a target="_blank" href='https://math.mit.edu/'>MIT Mathematics Department</a>, where I am advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/">Professor Michel X. Goemans</a>. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics (Combined Honours) with Distinction at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>, where I was very fortunate to be advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://bshepherd.ca/">Professor F. Bruce Shepherd</a>. Even before that, I attended <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sxyz.net/">Shaoxing No. 1 High School</a>, where I participated a lot in competitive programming.

My research interests include algorithms, combinatorics and optimization, in particular designing discrete algorithms and analyzing discrete structures. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science, operations research and graph theory.

While not doing mathematics, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, kayaking and skiing. I am peak-bagging the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1xaxmvyMnFQo9-5SqKyxh1VTOtMe3FeU&usp=sharing">"NH 48" list of 4000 footers in New Hampshire</a>.

You can find me at [first-name] [at] mit [dot] edu.
